## Unit Overview

The overall aim of this unit is to provide familiarity with the design, 
programming, operation, and design constraints of computing hardware. Thus, by
the end of this unit you should be able to:

* Read and write assembly language programs for a simple microcomputer.
* Identify the hardware components of a computer and the functions they perform.
* Describe the overall behaviour of compilers, assemblers, linkers and interpreters.
* Argue some of the trade-offs between hardware and software that occur in computers.
